# 🧠 Model Improvement Roadmap (Regression – Cooling/Heating Prediction)

## ✅ Phase 1: Finalize and Log Your Baseline

> **Goal**: Lock in a reliable baseline model for future comparison.

* [x] Train baseline model (e.g., `LinearRegression`)
* [x] Evaluate with cross-validation (CV MSE)
* [x] Evaluate on validation set (R², MSE, MAE)
* [x] Log results to CSV or performance tracker:

  * Model name
  * Features used
  * CV MSE (mean ± std)
  * Validation R², MSE, MAE

---

## 🔁 Phase 2: Try Other Models (Model Comparison)

> **Goal**: See if better-performing models exist.

* [ ] Test additional models (no tuning yet):

  * [ ] `DecisionTreeRegressor`
  * [ ] `RandomForestRegressor`
  * [ ] `XGBRegressor`
  * [ ] `KNeighborsRegressor`
  * [ ] `SVR` (requires scaling)
* [ ] Use same pipeline:

  * Cross-validation
  * Validation metrics
  * Log results

---

## ✂️ Phase 3: Feature Selection (Reduce Noise)

> **Goal**: Keep only informative features and improve generalization.

* [ ] **Filter method**:

  * [ ] Use correlation heatmap or absolute correlation values
* [ ] **Wrapper method**:

  * [ ] Use `RFE` with `LinearRegression` or `RandomForest`
* [ ] **Embedded method**:

  * [ ] Use `Lasso` or `SelectFromModel` with tree models

🔄 For each method:

* [ ] Select best features
* [ ] Re-train 1–2 top models
* [ ] Log performance

---

## ⚙️ Phase 4: Hyperparameter Tuning

> **Goal**: Boost performance of best models.

* [ ] Choose 1–2 promising models
* [ ] Use:

  * `GridSearchCV` for exhaustive tuning
  * `RandomizedSearchCV` for quick tuning
* [ ] Tune relevant parameters:

  * `max_depth`, `n_estimators`, `alpha`, etc.
* [ ] Evaluate and log performance

---

## 📊 Phase 5: Residuals and Visualization

> **Goal**: Understand model behavior and error patterns.

* [ ] Plot:

  * [ ] Actual vs Predicted (scatter plot)
  * [ ] Residuals vs Predicted
  * [ ] Histogram of residuals
* [ ] Use `cross_val_predict` for fold-wise predicted values (optional)

---

## 🏁 Final Evaluation and Model Selection

> **Goal**: Pick the best model for each target (cooling and heating).

* [ ] Compare all logged models:

  * Performance
  * Complexity
  * Overfitting risk
* [ ] Save best model using:

```python
import joblib
joblib.dump(model, 'best_model.pkl')
```

* [ ] Document final results:

  * Model, features, tuning params, metrics

---

## 🧠 Bonus (Optional Advanced)

* [ ] Try **stacking or blending** models
* [ ] Plot **learning curves** (train size vs performance)
* [ ] Try **PolynomialFeatures** if relationships appear nonlinear
