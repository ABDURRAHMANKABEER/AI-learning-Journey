# 🏗️ Energy Efficiency Prediction Project Plan

🎯 **Goal**: Predict the Heating Load and Cooling Load of buildings from architectural features using regression models.

📊 **Dataset**: [UCI Energy Efficiency Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Energy+efficiency)

📆 **Project Duration**: 7 Days  
📂 **Skill Level**: Intermediate Beginner → Intermediate

## ✅ Daily Breakdown

### 📆 Day 1: Setup & Data Exploration
- [ ] Download and load the dataset into a pandas DataFrame
- [ ] Explore structure with `.info()`, `.describe()`, `.head()`
- [ ] Check for missing values
- [ ] Plot histograms to observe distribution and skewness

---

### 📆 Day 2: Data Visualization & Feature Insights
- [ ] Plot a heatmap to show feature correlation
- [ ] Use pairplots to observe relationships
- [ ] Use boxplots for categorical vs target comparison
- [ ] Check multicollinearity (optional: VIF)

---

### 📆 Day 3: Preprocessing & Feature Engineering
- [ ] One-hot encode categorical features:
  - `Orientation`
  - `Glazing Area Distribution`
- [ ] Scale numerical features (StandardScaler or MinMaxScaler)
- [ ] Create optional interaction features
- [ ] Split data into train and test sets

---

### 📆 Day 4: Baseline Modeling – Linear Regression
- [ ] Train Linear Regression on Heating Load (Y1)
- [ ] Train Linear Regression on Cooling Load (Y2)
- [ ] (Optional) Try MultiOutputRegressor for both together
- [ ] Evaluate with MSE, RMSE, MAE, and R² Score

---

### 📆 Day 5: Advanced Models – Trees & Ensembles
- [ ] Train Random Forest Regressor
- [ ] Train XGBoost Regressor
- [ ] Use MultiOutputRegressor for predicting both targets
- [ ] Tune hyperparameters (max_depth, n_estimators, etc.)

---

### 📆 Day 6: Final Model Comparison & Visualization
- [ ] Compare all models based on RMSE and R²
- [ ] Plot Actual vs Predicted values
- [ ] Plot residuals (prediction errors)
- [ ] Select best-performing model(s)

---

### 📆 Day 7: Documentation & Wrap-Up
- [ ] Write a detailed `README.md` file:
  - Problem, dataset, process, and results
- [ ] Organize files into clean folders
- [ ] Push everything to GitHub
- [ ] Add a "Future Work" section for improvements

---

## 📂 Final Deliverables
- `project_notebook.ipynb` or `main.py`
- `energy-efficiency-plan.md` (this file)
- `README.md`
- Visualizations (saved as .png or shown in notebook)
- GitHub project repository

---

## 💡 Notes & Terms to Learn on the Way:
- **Multicollinearity**: When input features are strongly correlated with each other
- **Multi-output regression**: Predicting more than one output at once (Y1 & Y2)
- **MSE, RMSE, MAE, R²**: Metrics for regression model performance
- **Feature importance**: Tells you which inputs influence the output most

👊 Let’s go build something powerful and unique!
