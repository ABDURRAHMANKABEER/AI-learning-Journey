# AI Learning Journey 🚀

Welcome to my personal AI learning repository! This repo documents my progress as I learn and grow in the field of Artificial Intelligence, with a focus on practical projects, foundational theory, and hands-on exercises.

## 📁 Structure

The repository is organized by weeks to track consistent learning and implementation:


Each week includes:
- 📘 Notes and summaries from lessons
- 🧪 Small to medium-sized tasks or mini-projects
- 🧼 Data cleaning exercises and exploratory data analysis
- 💡 Insights and learnings

## 🧠 Goal

By the end of this journey, I aim to:
- Build strong AI foundations (Python, data preprocessing, ML basics)
- Get hands-on experience with real-world datasets
- Prepare for advanced concepts like deep learning and AI in control systems

## 🛠 Tools & Libraries

- Python
- pandas
- NumPy
- matplotlib / seaborn
- scikit-learn (later)
- Jupyter Notebooks

## 🔁 Progress

This repo will be updated weekly with:
- Cleaned datasets
- Code notebooks/scripts
- Weekly reflections
